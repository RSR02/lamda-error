# lamda-error
i need to connect the aws lambda with postgresql so that i can connect sqs lambda and postgresql . i need to do it because i have a task which says when the message is send into the sqs i have to note down it timestamp . so to note that first i am trying to connect the aws lamda with database and the i will add lambda trigger to sqs , in my local computer i can connect with database using this code but when i am uploading it to lambda it gives the error
